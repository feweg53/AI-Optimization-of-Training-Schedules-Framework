# AI-Optimized Flight Scheduling Framework

## Overview
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize flight schedules, focusing on predicting delays and enhancing operational efficiency. The framework encompasses data preparation, model selection, training, testing, and real-time data processing.

### Key Features:
- Predictive analytics for flight delay predictions.
- Data preprocessing and uncertainty handling.
- Robust model selection with hyperparameter tuning.
- Model training with scenario simulation.
- Comprehensive testing including scenario-based evaluations.
- Real-time data processing and model integration.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask for the web server
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy for data processing and machine learning
- Joblib for model serialization
- SHAP or LIME for model explanations
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/yourrepository/ai-flight-scheduling.git`

2. Install required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage
Run each Python script in the numbered order to execute the various phases of the project:

1. `1_DataPreparation.py` for preparing and preprocessing the data.
2. `2_ModelSelection.py` for model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
3. `3_TrainingModel.py` for model training.
4. `4_Testing.py` for testing the model.
5. `5_Server.py` to launch the Flask server for API endpoints.
6. `6_RealTimeDataProcessing.py` for handling real-time data processing.
