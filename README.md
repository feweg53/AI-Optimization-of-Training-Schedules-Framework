AI-Optimization-of-Training-Schedules-Framework
Overview:
The "AI-Optimization-of-Training-Schedules-Framework" is a comprehensive project aimed at enhancing the efficiency of flight training schedules through the application of artificial intelligence (AI). The project is structured into several Python scripts, each fulfilling a specific role in the data preparation, model selection, training, testing, and real-time data processing phases.

1_DataPreparation.py:
This script focuses on preparing the training data for the AI model. It includes functions for loading, cleaning, and preprocessing the flight schedule data. It addresses uncertainties such as variable flight times and changing conditions, adjusting the dataset accordingly. The script also handles categorical variable encoding, numerical column scaling, and finally, splits the data into training and testing sets.

2_ModelSelection.py:
The second script is responsible for model selection and hyperparameter tuning. It loads the preprocessed data, initializes a machine learning model (in this case, a Decision Tree or Random Forest), and performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. The tuned model is then saved for later use.

3_TrainingModel.py:
In this script, the tuned model is trained using the simulated training data generated by introducing various scheduling scenarios. It supports continuous learning by retraining the model with new data at specified intervals.

4_Testing.py:
The testing script evaluates the trained model's performance under different scenarios to assess its robustness. It provides accuracy scores and classification reports for each predefined scenario. Additionally, it includes a function to generate explanations for specific predictions, enhancing model interpretability.

6_RealTimeDataProcessing.py:
The real-time data processing script fetches data from a specified source, processes it, and sends the processed information to an existing scheduling system. This script is designed to run continuously, providing a seamless integration of AI predictions with real-time scheduling data.

script.js:
This JavaScript script handles the interaction with a web form, sending user-inputted data to a server for prediction. It demonstrates the real-world application of the AI model, allowing users to receive predictions based on departure time, weather conditions, and crew availability.

Important Note:
For full functionality, ensure that all dependencies are installed and that the necessary datasets are available. The project is well-documented through logging, facilitating error tracking and understanding of each script's execution.
