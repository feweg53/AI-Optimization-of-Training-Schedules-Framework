# AI-Optimization-of-Training-Schedules-Framework
Project Overview:
This project leverages artificial intelligence to optimize flight training schedules, enhancing efficiency and adaptability. It encompasses a suite of Python scripts, each tailored to a specific aspect of AI applicationâ€”from data preparation and model selection to training, testing, and real-time data integration.

1_DataPreparation.py:
- Purpose: Prepares training data for the AI model.
- Functions: Involves loading, cleaning, preprocessing flight schedule data.
- Key Features: Addresses uncertainties in flight times and conditions, encodes categorical variables, scales numerical columns, and splits data into training and testing sets.

2_ModelSelection.py:
- Purpose: Selects and tunes the machine learning model.
- Functions: Loads preprocessed data, initializes a Decision Tree or Random Forest model, and conducts hyperparameter tuning - using GridSearchCV.
Outcome: Saves the optimized model for subsequent training and application.

3_TrainingModel.py:
- Purpose: Trains the tuned model using simulated data.
- Functions: Generates various scheduling scenarios for training, supports continuous learning by retraining with new data.
- Integration: Facilitates ongoing model refinement to adapt to evolving data patterns.

4_Testing.py:
- Purpose: Evaluates the trained model's performance.
- Functions: Tests the model under different scenarios, provides accuracy scores and classification reports.
- Interpretability: Includes a function for generating explanations for predictions, enhancing model transparency.

5_Server.py:
- Purpose: Facilitates server-side handling of prediction requests.
- Functions: Sets up a Flask server, processes incoming data for prediction, and returns model's predictions.
- Application: Acts as a backend for web applications or APIs for real-time flight schedule predictions.

6_RealTimeDataProcessing.py:
- Purpose: Processes and integrates real-time data with AI predictions.
- Functions: Continuously fetches, processes real-time data, and communicates with the scheduling system.
- Integration: Seamlessly blends AI insights into real-time operational decision-making.

script.js + index.html:
- Purpose: Manages user interactions on a web interface.
- Functions: Captures user inputs from a web form, sends it to the server for prediction, and displays the results.
- Application: Demonstrates the practical use of the AI model, offering predictions based on user inputs like departure time - and weather conditions.

your_dataset.csv:
- Sample input.

Note:
For full functionality, ensure that all dependencies are installed and that the necessary datasets are available. The project is well-documented through logging, facilitating error tracking and understanding of each script's execution.
